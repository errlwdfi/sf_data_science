### Project description
Predict a number made up by computer in minimum number of attempts

### What kind of case is solving?
Write a program which predicts a number in minimum number of attempts

**Conditions of the competition:**
- Computer makes up a number from 0 to 100, and we have to predict it. By "predict" it's meant "to write a program which guesses a number"
- Algorithm considers information about whether a random number less or greater than the predicted one

**The quality metrics**

The results are estimated by average number of attempts per 1000 tries

**What is practising?**

We are learning to write a fine code in Python
